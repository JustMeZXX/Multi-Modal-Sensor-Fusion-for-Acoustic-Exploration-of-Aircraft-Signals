# Exploring Acoustic Characteristics of Different Aircraft Types Using Automatic Labeling of Aircraft Tracking Data

This repo is the official implementation for [Exploring Acoustic Characteristics of Different Aircraft Types Using Automatic Labeling of Aircraft Tracking Data].

### Dataset
The dataset is uploaded in [dataset](https://github.com/JustMeZXX/Multi-Modal-Sensor-Fusion-for-Acoustic-Exploration-of-Aircraft-Signals/tree/main/data), please follow the readme file to get access to the data.

### Code
The code is released in [code](https://github.com/JustMeZXX/Multi-Modal-Sensor-Fusion-for-Acoustic-Exploration-of-Aircraft-Signals/tree/main/code). The code implemented for this study consists of two parts: synchronization (code_01_synchronization.m) and association (code_02_association.m). Please download the data and run the code.
